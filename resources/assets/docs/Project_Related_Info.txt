Udistro:

1. Laratrust is added to maintain the ACL.

2. I have changed the Un-authorized route redirect from: '/login' -> '/'

Go to: app\Exceptions and change the following:

protected function unauthenticated($request, AuthenticationException $exception)
{
    if ($request->expectsJson()) {
        return response()->json(['error' => 'Unauthenticated.'], 401);
    }

    return redirect()->guest(route('login')); 	// Change this line
}

3. The different types of user present in the system are:

	# Company:
		# Representative (For all companies)
		# Agent (For real estate companies)
